Problem statement:

Problematic internet use among children and adolescents is linked to mental health issues but is often difficult to measure due to reliance on professional assessments. Physical activity and fitness data, however, are easily accessible and can indicate early signs of excessive screen time. This project aims to develop a predictive model that uses children's physical activity data to identify early indicators of problematic internet use, enabling timely interventions to promote healthier digital habits. 
During participation in the HBN study, some participants were given an accelerometer to wear for up to 30 days continually while at home and going about their regular daily lives.
